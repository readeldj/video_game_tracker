Video Game Tracker

A CLI Ruby app to track the Games you Have and the ones you Want

## Project Vision

This will be a small command-line program that asks the user about the games they have/want.

Users will be able to CRUD a game in the list. The user will also be able to create lists of the games they already own or ones they would like.

## Features

# List out games
# 
# Add new games
* Replace games that have been traded
* Update games
* Delete games that they no longer own


## Import CSV list of existing games already owned

The user already has a list of the current games they already own. They can place these in CSV format so that they can be quickly imported into the database.
