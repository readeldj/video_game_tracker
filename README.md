# Video Game Tracker

A CLI Ruby app to track the Games you Have and the ones you Want

## Project Vision

This will be a small command-line program that asks the user about the games they have/want.

Users will be able to CRUD a game in the list. The user will also be able to create lists of the games they already own or ones they would like.

## Features

### List out games

The user will be able to print out lists of either games they already own or ones they want.
Games will list:
 * What systems they can be played on (1 or more Wii, XBox, iOS...)
 * There age rating
 * Can Play Online/MultiPlayer

### Add new games

Users will spend their Allowance to buy more games. We will be able to add these to the DB.

### Update games

Users might already own the the game in App version on a tablet. They might decide to purcahse the game for their game console which is attached to a TV or Monitor. They will be able to update that game in the DB with the addition on the new system which it can be played on.

Games that where on the "Wanted" list may be purchased eventually. We will be able to update that Own/Want status.

### Delete games

Users can trade games with their friends, sale them on VarageSale, trade at GameStop, or they can be taken away by their parents when they cross the wrong line. They will be able to remove these games from the DB.


## Import CSV list of existing games already owned

The user already has a list of the current games they already own. They can place these in CSV format so that they can be quickly imported into the database.
